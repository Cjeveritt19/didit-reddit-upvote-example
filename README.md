## REFLECTION

This week i struggled hard with this assignment when it came to the errors. I had an issue with loading the project locally and on vercel. The vercel issue was quite easy to fix after managing to load it locally all it was, was entering the correct enviroments. To make it load locally I had to re do npm install and then also close every tab on my computer as my computer runs too slow while having everything open.

I think having these errors improves me as a developer as I can new knowledge on these issues and can then improve on fixing the errors. I had alot of help from Joe due to this errors but asking Joe for help and working on it has been knowledgeable.

I think this assignment was meant to be easy but with the errors and trying to understand them all made the assignment harder.
